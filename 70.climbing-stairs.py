# You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
# 
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can
# you climb to the top?
# 
# Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n<=2:
            return n
        else: 
            cur1 = 1
            cur2 = 2
            for _ in range(n-2):
                cur3=cur1+cur2
                cur1=cur2
                cur2=cur3
            return cur3
